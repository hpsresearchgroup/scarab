#+title: Victim Cache Design

* Victim Cache
The victim cache is a small (2-5 line) fully-associative cache placed between the D-cache and
memory. It is designed for cases where a small number of values fighting for the same block are
repeatedly flushed in favor of the other, causing a high number of expensive misses. Instead, now
the flushed address is stored in the victim cache so the miss penalty is just one cycle rather than
the expensive memory access.
