""" BatchManager

The BatchManager is responsible for creating and maintaining an order of parallel Commands/ScarabRuns to be launched
on a job submission system (such as your local machine, PBS, or SBATCH). This file defines several objects (listed
under Interface below) which are used to specify if jobs can be run in parallel or must be run sequentially.

The BatchManager tracks what we refer to in the documentation as "jobs". Specifically, jobs are either a Command object
(defined in scarab_globals/command.py) or a ScarabRun object (defined in scarab_globals/scarab_batch_types.py). A command
is simply a wrapper class around any arbitrary Unix command. A ScarabRun is specifically a set of Commands meant to launch
several instances of Scarab on the same set of paramters (but accross multiple benchmarks). 

The BatchManager organizes jobs into Phases. A Phase (defined in this file) is a set of Commands or ScarabRuns that can
be run in any order or in parallel. The BatchManager maintains a list of phases, which must be run sequentially. That is
a phase cannot begin execution until all of the jobs within the previous phase have terminated (either in success or failure).

Interface:
  Command: A wrapper class around an arbitrary Unix command (defined in scarab_globals/command.py).
  ScarabRun: A set of Commands meant to launch several instances of Scarab on the same set of ScarabParams,
           but across multiple benchmarks.
  Phase: A set of jobs (Commands or ScarabRun objects) that can be run in any order or in parallel. The phase is complete
           once all of the jobs have completed (either in success or failure). Phases must be run sequentially. That is, 
           the next phase cannot begin until the current phase has completed.

Types of BatchManagers:
  BatchManager: This will run jobs on locally on your machine. By default, BatchManager will greedily launch one job per core
          on your local system. Although this can be configured (see the constructor for BatchManager).
  PBSBatchManager: This will launch jobs on a PBS system. All jobs will be launched at once, however the dependencies between
          jobs will be conveyed to PBS. See the constructor for PBSJobManager for more details.
