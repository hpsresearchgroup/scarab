Description: Globally tracks objects declared in Scarab Batch jobfiles.

The purpose of this file is to provide an interface for globally tracking all declared objects. 
This is useful because objects are declared by users in jobfiles, and are usually not directly
operated on by the user. Typical use cases are the user directs Scarab Batch on how to operate
on the objects. Scarab Batch uses the globally tracked objects and the directives from the user
(e.g., run, progress, stat) to perform the appropriate task.
